# Sitewide Alert Manager

A lightweight JavaScript component that adds a customizable, dismissible alert bar to any website â€” perfect for maintenance messages, urgent announcements, or "we broke something, oops" notices.

This component stores dismiss state in `localStorage` so users won't see the alert again once they've closed it.

## ðŸ’¡ Features

- Customizable message and background color
- Persistent dismiss button (doesn't come back unless reset)
- Simple setup: drop in one JS file and a container element
- Works with any website (no dependencies)
